By the way, your enthusiasm is the first step to mastering programming!\n\nSo, you wrote a tiny program that's supposed to greet someone, right? But instead of a friendly \"hello\" popping up, it's giving you this confusing message. Let's understand why together.\n\nImagine you have a box, and you label it \"greeting.\" Inside this box, you want to put a small note that says \"hello.\" However, when you wrote your program, you mentioned the note, but you forgot to write what's on it. When the computer opened the box to show the note to everyone, it found the note missing. That's why it's confused and giving you an error.\n\nIn the world of Python, what you did is you created a function called `greeting` - think of it as our box. Inside this function, you told Python to show (print) `hello`. But Python is looking around and saying, \"What is 'hello'? I've never seen this before!\"\n\nHere's how we can solve this mystery:\n\n### Your Original Code\n```python\ndef greeting():\n  print(hello)\ngreeting()\n```\n\n### The Confusion\n- Python sees `hello` but doesn't know what it is because it's not in quotes. Without quotes, Python thinks `hello` is a name of something like a variable (a container that holds information) that it has never seen before.\n\n### How To Fix It\nTo tell Python that you mean the word \"hello\" as a greeting and not a variable, you need to put it in quotes. This way, Python understands it's a string of text you want to show.\n\n### Fixed Code\n```python\ndef greeting():\n  print(\"hello\")  # Notice the quotes around hello now\ngreeting()\n```\n\nBy adding quotes, you're basically saying, \"Hey, Python, 'hello' is just a message I want you to print out; itâ€™s not a variable or anything confusing.\"\n\nRun the fixed code, and you'll see that it happily prints out `hello`, just like you wanted!\n\nThink of programming as telling your computer a bedtime story. If you skip pages or leave out details, your computer might get a bit lost. The amazing part is, you're learning to write those stories in a way your computer understands, which is super cool.\n\nKeep at it, and don't hesitate to ask more questions. Every programmer started where you are now, and every mistake is a step towards mastery!"
